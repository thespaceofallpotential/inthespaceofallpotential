Sixty years ago, Thomas Kuhn wrote **The Structure of Scientific Revolutions** _(Structure)_, and it was noticed [1](#footnote-1) .

But for all subsequent attention and discussion, _including the broader proliferation of Structures' concepts into society at large_, the most profound implication of Kuhn's insight, appears to have been missed.

---

The unsatisfactory gist of _Structure_, is that our species is dependent upon rare, scoped, revolutionary events within science, to better realise the potential of any current or future scientific discipline.

But, there is one unnoticed circumstance under which Kuhn's analytical measures invert. And on considering that circumstance –_under specific conditions and constraints_, an almost paradoxical conclusion becomes apparent:

### It is simpler, more potent, more predictable, and more assured, to revolutionise all science comprehensively _by unification_, than by attempting or depending upon periodic, disciplinarily distinct, revolutionary progression.

1.  Single-discipline scientific revolution can never maximally realise the potential of any scientific discipline
    
2.  Science itself, must be revolutionised, with a new paradigm to unify all scientific disciplines, current and future
    
3.  A unified scientific paradigm can be logically derived from Kuhn's _Structure_
    
4.  A unified scientific paradigm applies to all universal phenomena, and maps to _and exposes_, a coherent territory
    
    1.  Coherent maps can be logically and formally constructed, evaluated, reconciled, related, verified, and predicted
        
    2.  The coherent maps of a coherent paradigm assure, by the innate assurance of innate coherent territory
        
5.  A unified scientific paradigm is the only means for the comprehensive, maximal, realisation of potential, for any scientific discipline
    
    1.  The realisation of scientific potential equates to minimising delta between map and territory. Optimal maps are composed of universally common representations, _which better fit coherent territory_. And maps composed of uncommon representations, necessarily fit less-well.
        
    2.  Worse, uncommon representations distract, and mislead

These words explore the case, _and consequences_, of **the next, and last, scientific revolution**, on science, knowledge and understanding, phenomenological experience, technology, community, society, civilisation, the planet, and beyond.
